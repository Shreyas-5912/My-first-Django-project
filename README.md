# 🎉 **My First Django Project: FoodApp** 🍔🍕🥗

Welcome to **FoodApp**, my very first Django project! 🎉 This is a simple yet powerful food management app where users can add, view, and manage food items. It's got everything you'd expect from a basic CRUD app, built with Django, Bootstrap, and a sprinkle of my enthusiasm for learning!

### 🚀 **Project Overview**

FoodApp allows users to:

- **Add new food items** (Because everyone loves food, right?)
- **View and manage food items** (Make your meals organized)
- **Login and register** (For personalized food management)

It’s all powered by Django, and styled beautifully with Bootstrap to give it that modern flair.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Backend:** Django 5.x
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Database:** SQLite (default in Django, easy to get started!)
- **Authentication:** Django’s built-in authentication system
